      "\n",
      "From clue 2, the person who drinks milk lives next to the person who owns the yellow house. This means the yellow house cannot be in the first or the last position because there needs to be a house next to it for the person who drinks milk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering clue 5, the American lives in the red house. This information, combined with clue 1, means the first house (Canadian) cannot be red, so the red house must be one of the other four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given clue 7 (the green house is to the immediate left of the white house), and knowing the Canadian is in the first house, we can start to piece together some possibilities. But let's use the other clues to narrow down the options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue 4 tells us the person who drinks coffee lives in the house next to the British person. Clue 6 indicates the person who drinks tea lives in the house next to the person who drinks water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, combining all clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Canadian lives in the first house.\n",
      "2. The yellow house, with the person drinking soda, has to be next to the person drinking milk.\n",

      "Let's start with what we can deduce directly:\n",
      "- The Canadian is in the first house.\n",
      "- The green and white houses are together, in that order.\n",
      "- The American is in the red house.\n",
      "- The yellow house drinks soda and must be next to the person who drinks milk.\n",

      "4. Green - ? (Because it's to the left of white)\n",
      "5. White - ?\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 5, the American lives in the red house. This means the red house cannot be the first house (Canadian), and since the green and white houses are together, the red house must either be the second, third, or fifth house. However, if it were the fifth house, there wouldn't be room for the green and white houses to be together unless the red house were one of the first four. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the yellow house drinks soda and must be next to milk, and considering the arrangement of the green and white houses, let's try fitting the known pieces more systematically:\n",

      "Since the Canadian is in the first house, and we have the American in the red house, and knowing the green and white houses are together, one possible arrangement considering all constraints could be:\n",

      "4. Green - ? \n",
      "5. White - ?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- The person who drinks coffee lives next to the British person (clue 4).\n",
      "- The person who drinks tea lives next to the person who drinks water (clue 6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's directly apply what we know about the houses' colors and the occupants' nationalities and drinks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian lives in the first house. If we consider the green and white houses together and the American in the red house, we have to fit in the yellow house with soda and its adjacent milk drinker, along with the coffee and tea/water drinkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given all the clues, one possible correct arrangement that fits all given conditions is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Yellow doesn't fit here because of clue 2, so let's start with the Canadian and fit the rest.\n",
      "   - Canadian (first house) can't be in the yellow or red house (American's house), so let's consider other colors.\n",
      "2. The yellow house cannot be first (because of the milk clue), so it must be elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's solve it directly with a systematic approach considering all clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Canadian (first house) - Let's say the house is blue (as we have to assign colors and this is a starting point).\n",
      "   - Canadian, Blue, ?\n",
      "2. The second house needs to be a color that fits with the rest of the clues. Considering the green and white houses are together, and we have a red house for the American, and a yellow house for soda, let's place the green and white houses and fit the rest.\n",
      "3. Since the green house is to the immediate left of the white house, and we have the Canadian in the first house, we can start fitting the nationalities and drinks:\n",
      "   - If the Canadian drinks coffee, the British person must be next door (clue 4), which would be the second house.\n",
      "4. However, we need to fit the yellow house (soda) next to the person who drinks milk, and the American is in the red house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all clues and fitting them systematically:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's directly place known elements and solve:\n",

      "- The American lives in the red house.\n",
      "- Green is to the left of white.\n",
      "- Yellow drinks soda and is next to milk.\n",

    "   - This gives us a starting point. The first house is occupied by a Canadian, but we don't know the color of the house or their favorite drink yet.\n",

    "2. **The person who drinks milk lives next to the person who owns the yellow house.**\n",
    "   - This means the yellow house cannot be the first or the last house since the person who drinks milk needs to live next to it. Possible positions for the yellow house are 2, 3, or 4.\n",

    "3. **The person who owns the yellow house drinks soda.**\n",

    "5. **The American lives in the red house.**\n",
    "   - This gives us another fixed point: the American lives in the red house, but we don't know the position of the red house or the favorite drink of the American.\n",

    "6. **The person who drinks tea lives in the house next to the person who drinks water.**\n",
